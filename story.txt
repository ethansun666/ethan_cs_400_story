Sausage is a 3 years old kitten. He is 20 pound and he loves to eat.
Sausage does not like to eat sausages because his owner yells at him for even attempting to do so. Sausage's favorite food consists of mahi mahi fish tacos and sushi. Sausage is very fat as a result of eating so much food.
Sausage's owner, Joe, loves Sausage very much. When it is warm outside, Joe lets Sausage roam around the backyard. Usually, though, Sausage is very lazy and watches TV with Joe in the living room.
